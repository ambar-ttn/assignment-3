# Responsive Blog Layout

This assignment is focused on implementing **responsiveness using HTML and CSS**.

## What I implemented for responsiveness

### Desktop / Laptop
- Both **left featured section** and **right article list** are visible.
- Layout uses Flexbox for proper spacing and alignment.
- Images and text are displayed side-by-side in cards.

### Tablet
- Left section is hidden to keep the layout clean.
- Articles are displayed as **cards in a row**.
- A **category card overlaps the image** to improve the visual design.
- Images maintain proper aspect ratio and do not break.

### Mobile
- Left section is hidden.
- **Search bar is visible** for better usability.
- Articles are stacked vertically for easy scrolling.
